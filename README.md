#  Bunnymark Mk II

## Introduction
This is the Bunnymark Mk II benchmark for Love2D. It is forked from the original Bunnymark Mk I and is used to 
test the graphic card performance. It is originally written by Rishav Sharan and is a port of the famous pixiJS.

This is adapted for the use of benchmarking Embedded Computers and as such some 
extra system information is implemented.

## Run 

Clone the repo, install love2d and run on the current dir:

```bash
love .
```

## Controls

Left click: Spawns a litter of bunnies (default minimum 1000)
Scroll wheel: Decrease or increase the bunny number
